frankxieke.github.com is a User / Organization Pages , and its url is like http://frankxieke.github.io.

Below is the difference.

User / Organization pages live in a specially named repository called username.github.io, and publish from the master branch. They can be browsed at http://username.github.io.

Project pages can be part of any repository, and are published from the special gh-pages branch. They can be browsed at http://username.github.io/project-name.

If you want to have a project page, make sure that your repository is not named after your GitHub user name. If you want your project to be available at http://username.github.io, you must have a User / Organization Page, which must publish from the master branch.

I want to be a technological master, so I must spend more time to do it !


###this is my first blog
    #include<stdio.h>
    int main()
    {
        printf("hello world\n");
        return 0;
    }

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
